# Space-Quality-Scoring

## Intro

An image-based spatial quality scoring script that analyzes the comfort of an indoor space, taking into account materiality, lighting, scale, and decoration.

## Setup

Save both scripts and the image files in the same folder, then run the script. The visualization is designed for image sequencesâ€”preferably frames extracted from a video of the space.

## What's Next

Combine this with sentiment analysis to explore how objective image-based scoring aligns with subjective emotional responses. (Updated, please run "machin_view.ipynb" to get the analysis)
